//! A safer, more ergonomic interface for event-sourced entities
//! on top of cqrs-es.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! cqrs-es provides the `Aggregate` trait, but it has several
//! sharp edges that have caused production bugs:
//!
//! - **Infallible `apply`**: `Aggregate::apply(&mut self, event)`
//!   returns nothing. Financial applications cannot panic on
//!   arithmetic overflow, so every aggregate needs a wrapper to
//!   capture errors without panicking. Every aggregate in the
//!   codebase had identical boilerplate for this.
//!
//! - **Stringly-typed aggregate IDs**: `cqrs.execute("some-id",
//!   cmd)` takes `&str`, making it trivial to pass the wrong ID.
//!   This has caused production bugs.
//!
//! - **Manual schema versioning**: When aggregate or view schemas
//!   change, a stale `SCHEMA_VERSION` leaves snapshots and views
//!   in the old shape. Bumping it is the operator's responsibility;
//!   [`EventSourced::SCHEMA_VERSION`] plus startup reconciliation
//!   clears version-mismatched snapshots and rebuilds views. On load,
//!   an incompatible snapshot for a [`CompactionPolicy::Retain`]
//!   aggregate is ignored and the entity rebuilt from its
//!   always-present event history; for a
//!   [`CompactionPolicy::CompactAfterSnapshot`] aggregate it instead
//!   surfaces an error, since its events may be gone and the snapshot
//!   is the only durable state -- so state is never silently lost.
//!
//! - **Flat command handling**: A single `handle` method receives
//!   all commands regardless of lifecycle state. Implementors
//!   must manually match on (lifecycle_state, command) tuples,
//!   making it easy to accidentally reference state during
//!   initialization or forget to handle a case.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`EventSourced`] replaces direct `Aggregate` usage. Domain
//! types implement `EventSourced`, and [`Lifecycle`] provides a
//! blanket `Aggregate` impl that bridges to cqrs-es. Consumers
//! interact through [`Store`], which enforces typed IDs and hides
//! cqrs-es internals.
//!
//! ```text
//! Domain type          Adapter             cqrs-es
//! +--------------+     +----------------+  +------------+
//! | impl         | --> | Lifecycle      |  | Aggregate  |
//! | EventSourced |     | (blanket impl) |--| trait      |
//! +--------------+     +----------------+  +------------+
//!                             |
//!                      +------+------+
//!                      | Store       |
//!                      | (typed IDs, |
//!                      |  send())    |
//!                      +-------------+
//! ```
//!
//! # Naming
//!
//! Method names follow two themes to distinguish their purpose:
//!
//! **Event-side** (replaying events to reconstruct state) uses
//! evolution-themed names:
//! - [`originate`](EventSourced::originate) -- create initial
//!   state from the first event
//! - [`evolve`](EventSourced::evolve) -- derive new state from
//!   subsequent events
//!
//! **Command-side** (processing commands to produce events) uses
//! state-machine names:
//! - [`initialize`](EventSourced::initialize) -- handle a
//!   command when no state exists yet
//! - [`transition`](EventSourced::transition) -- handle a
//!   command against existing state
//!
//! The asymmetry is intentional: commands express intent,
//! events express facts. Different verbs for different
//! semantics.
//!
//! cqrs-es names (`Aggregate`, `Query`, `View`, `DomainEvent`)
//! are deliberately avoided in our public API to make it
//! immediately obvious whether code belongs to this crate or
//! to cqrs-es.

/// - `Event`: Domain events that drive state changes. Must be
///   `Eq` so lifecycle error states can carry typed events.
/// - `Command`: Instructions that produce events. A single
///   command type is used for both initialization and
///   transitions -- the lifecycle routes based on state.
/// - `Error`: Domain-specific errors from command handling or
///   event application (e.g., arithmetic overflow). For
///   entities with infallible operations, use [`Never`].
/// - `Services`: External dependencies injected into command
///   handlers (e.g., `Arc<dyn OrderPlacer>`). Use `()` when

///
/// # Constants
///
/// - `AGGREGATE_TYPE`: Stable identifier for the event store.
///   Must not change after events are persisted.
/// - `SCHEMA_VERSION`: Bump when the entity's state, event, or
///   view schema changes. On startup, the wiring infrastructure
///   detects version mismatches and automatically clears stale
///   snapshots and replays views.
///
/// # Event-side methods
///
/// These reconstruct state from the event log during replay.
/// They are called by the blanket `Aggregate::apply` impl on
/// [`Lifecycle`], never by application code directly.
///
/// - `originate`: Attempt to create initial state from an
///   event. Returns `Some(state)` for genesis events, `None`
///   for events that require existing state.
/// - `evolve`: Attempt to derive new state from an event
///   applied to existing state. Returns `Ok(Some(new_state))`
///   on success, `Ok(None)` if the event doesn't apply to the
///   current state (mismatch), or `Err` for domain failures
///   like arithmetic overflow.
///
/// # Command-side methods
///
/// These process commands to produce events. They are called by
/// the blanket `Aggregate::handle` impl on [`Lifecycle`], which
/// routes commands based on lifecycle state.
///
/// - `initialize`: Handle a command when the entity doesn't
///   exist yet. Has no `&self` parameter, preventing accidental
///   reference to existing state during creation.
/// - `transition`: Handle a command against existing state.
///   Receives `&self` (the domain type, not `Lifecycle`), so
