/// Implemented as a higher-kinded type emulation: the GAT
/// [`Repo`](Self::Repo) is a "type-level function"
/// `(View, Aggregate) -> SomeRepo` that [`crate::Projection`]
/// applies internally to obtain a repository for
/// `(Lifecycle<Entity>, Lifecycle<Entity>)`. This lets
/// `Projection<Entity, Backend>` express its repository requirement
/// without naming the `pub(crate)` `Lifecycle` type in any public
/// bound — the `Lifecycle` saturation happens inside the struct,
/// not in the impl `where` clauses.
///
/// Why this exists: Rust lacks native HKT, so we cannot write
/// `Projection<Entity, Repo<_, _>>` and have the compiler apply
/// `Repo` to `Lifecycle<Entity>`. The GAT-on-trait pattern below
/// is the standard workaround. The `Send + Sync + 'static` bound
/// on the GAT itself means downstream impls don't have to repeat
/// these bounds (and so don't reintroduce `Lifecycle` into their
/// `where` clauses).
